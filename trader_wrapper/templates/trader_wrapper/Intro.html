                    Thank you for your participation in an economic experiment, in which you have the chance to trade on
                    a virtual financial market. The experiment is composed of several rounds. In each round, all
                    monetary values will be expressed in ECUs (Experimental Currency Unit). At the end of the
                    experiment, one round will be chosen at random to determine your payoff (on top of the participation
                    credit). For this purpose, ECUs you earned will be converted into Canadian Dollars at the rate of X
                    CAD/ECU. [The actual number for the exchange rate to be inserted here.] If you ended this randomly
                    chosen round with a negative payoff, your profit will be considered to be zero.

                    The experimental interface has two components (i.e., website tabs). The first tab corresponds to a
                    trading platform where you can buy and sell virtual assets. In the second tab, you have the
                    opportunity to perform a simple non-financial task. You can earn ECUs either through profitable
                    stock trades, or by performing non-financial tasks. You can switch between the two components at any
                    point throughout a round.
