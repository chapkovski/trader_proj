            Welcome and thank you for participating in the trading experiment! <br>
            Please read the instructions carefully. To proceed with the experiment, you will need to correctly
            answer four
            validation questions to verify your understanding of the instructions. </p>

                <ol class="list-group">
                    <li> After completing the validation questions, you will be redirected to a platform where you
                        can:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Trade virtual assets (via a <b>Trade</b> tab) and/or</li>
                            <li> Complete simple numerical tasks (via a <b>Work</b> tab)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> You can freely switch between the trading and work tabs at all times during the
                        experiment.
                    </li>
                    <li> The game progresses over {{ gps.num_rounds }} rounds of {{ gps.day_length_in_min }} minutes each.</li>
                    <li> In each round, you can earn money either by:
                        <ul>
                            <li> Making a profit through buying and selling assets.</li>
                            <li> Earning a fixed wage for each numerical task you complete.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> After each round, you will see a screen with your total wealth at the end of the round.
                    </li>
                    <li> The rounds are independent of each other meaning that your progress (portfolio and bank
                        account) will be reset at the beginning of each round.
                    </li>
                    <li> After the {{ gps.num_rounds }} rounds, you will complete a 10-question quiz on trading and investments. <br>
                        Do not worry if you do not have prior finance knowledge or experience in trading: Just
                        answer to the best of your ability. <br>
                        You will receive a bonus payment for each question you answer correctly on the quiz.
                    </li>
                    <li> At the end of the experiment, one of the trading rounds will be selected at random as your
                        payment round. <br>
                        You will receive a bonus payment proportional to the wealth in the randomly selected round, at a
                        rate of 1 E$ = {{ gps.real_world_current_per_point }} CA$ (E$ stands for "experimental dollars").
                        So think and play in each round as if it is the round that counts, because it might be!
