            Welcome and thank you for participating in the trading experiment! <br>
            Please read the instructions carefully. To proceed with the experiment, you will need to correctly
            answer three validation questions to verify your understanding of the instructions. </p>

                    <li> After completing the validation questions, you will be redirected to a trading platform where
                        your job is to decide if and when to sell a virtual stock. </li>
                    <li> Think of the stock as an asset that you own. You can choose to sell it for experimental cash, and you can do it at any time. </li>
                    <li> The price of the stock changes every {{gps.tick_frequency}} seconds. The starting price is E$ {{gps.starting_price}}
                        (E$ stands for experimental dollars). </li>
                    <li> At each price update, the price can crash to zero with some probability <b>p</b>. The "crash" probability will be disclosed to you in each round.</li>
                    <li> If there is no crash (with probability <b>1-p</b>), the asset price can either stay the same, or go up by either E$1 or E$2. All three outcomes are equally likely.</li>
                    <li> You will interact with the platform over {{gps.game_rounds}} rounds. Each round is {{gps.round_length}} seconds long. </li>
                    <li> The rounds can also end earlier if you sell the asset or if the price crashes to zero, whichever comes first. </li>

                    <li> In each round you can earn money by either holding on to the asset and receiving its value at the end of the round or by selling it and receive the cash equivalent in E$.
                    </li>
                    <li> After each round, you will see a screen with your payoff at the end of the round. </li>
                    <li> The rounds are independent of each other: your balance is reset at the beginning of each round.
                    </li>
                    <li> After the {{gps.game_rounds}} rounds, you will complete a short quiz on trading and investments. <br>
                        Do not worry if you do not have prior finance knowledge or experience in trading: Just answer to the best of your ability. <br>
                        You will receive a bonus payment for each question you answer correctly on the quiz.
                    </li>
                    <li> At the end of the experiment, one of the trading rounds will be selected at random as your payment round. <br>
                        You will receive a bonus payment proportional to your selling profit in the randomly selected round, at a rate of 1 E$ = CAD${{gps.exchange_rate}}. <br>
                        So, think and play in each round as if it is the round that counts, because it might be! </li>
